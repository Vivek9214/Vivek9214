# 💻 Vivek Gahlot – Learning & Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal repository, where I document my academic and self-taught journey in programming, data structures, and data analysis. With a non-technical background in commerce and a deep curiosity for technology, I am currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)** and building a strong foundation in software development and data science.
